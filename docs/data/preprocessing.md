The preprocessing script provided in this repository is designed for loading, resizing, normalising, and saving images. 
This script is particularly useful for preparing a dataset for building footprint detection and damage assessment 
projects. 

The script reads images from a specified directory, applies resizing, normalises pixel values to the range [0, 1], 
and saves the processed images to a new directory.
